# BasicArduino
I'm going to learn how to use Arduino, and make awesome things with it.

## HelloArduino

### Description & Code

For this assignment we had to have an LED blink on and off and say "Hello!" Wiring up the light was fairly easy but make sure to have a resistor.

### Reflection

This was my first assignment involving code and I had fun making a code of my own, even if it was a simple one.

# FiniteLEDBlink

### Description & Code

For this assignment I had to make an LED blink 5 times then stop. The code was a little more complex than the previous assignment, but it was still easy once i looked at other peoples' codes for guidelines.

### Reflection

I enjoyed learning how to add specifications to my LED blinks and others on the internet made it much easier.

# VariableLEDBlink

### Description & Code

For this assignment we had to make an LED blink at a beginning pace, then slowly raise the speed of the LED blinks. I had to ask for help for this assignment but after I had the problem fixed the code ran smoothly.

### Image or Wiring

No wiring needed for this one, the LED on the arduino will blink.

### Reflection

I enjoyed having a challenge with my coding and fixing an issue that I previously had in my code.

# OneButtonOneLED

### Description & Code

For this assignment we had to make it so that when a button was pressed, the LED would blink twice then shut off. I enjoyed making an LED almost like a light switch in a house.

### Evidence

### Image or Wiring

No wiring needed for this one, the LED on the arduino will blink, and there is a button.

### Reflection

I had to make a few inputs for this code and had to play with low and high power on the LED, but I made a code that worked in the end.
